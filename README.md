# This is the group project I completed for DS4200: Data Visualization and Presentation.

We were tasked with creating data visualizations that can be of use to a designated stakeholder. We designed an interactive graph for the team at BlueBikes responsible for deploying stations. Our visualizations used bike accident data paired with station data, to hopefully ensure safety of the BlueBikes customers.
The first graph is a heat map of bike accidents, with points of where stations are located. If you hover over the points, you can see the in and out flow of each station. If you switch modes, you can drag your mouse over the left graph to see where accidents are occuring (street versus intersection). This data can be of use to our stakeholders, who can hopefully use this to carefully place stations away from hazardous areas.

# What I contributed:
Once my group had created the heatmap, I was responsible for making the bar and pie chart, and linking these charts to the heat map such that they were interactive. This involved creating tooltips, brushing and linking, and hovering over elements to regenerate new graphs. I also was a large part of the design process, where I was accessing who our stakeholders are, and what visualizations could be used to help in their decision making of where BlueBike stations should be to ensure safety.
