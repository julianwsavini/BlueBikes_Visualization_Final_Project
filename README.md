# This is the group project I completed for DS4200: Data Visualization and Presentation.

We were tasked with creating data visualizations to be used by a designated stakeholder. We designed an interactive graph for the team at BlueBikes that is responsible for establishing station locations. Our visualizations used bike accident data paired with station data, to hopefully increase safety for BlueBikes customers. The first graph is a heat map of bike accidents with points where stations are located. Hovering over the points shows the in- and out-flow of each station. If you switch modes, you can drag your mouse over the left graph to see where accidents occur (street versus intersection). This data can be used by BlueBikes when determining station locationsfarther from hazardous areas.

# What I contributed:
Once my group had created the heatmap, I was responsible for creating the bar and pie chart, as well as for linking these charts to the heat map such that they were interactive. This involved creating tooltips, brushing and linking, and hovering over elements to regenerate new graphs. I played a large part in the design process, as I assessed who our stakeholders were, and which visualizations would be most useful in their decision making regarding safe placement of BlueBikes stations.

Technologies I used: HTML, CSS, Javascript (d3 library)
